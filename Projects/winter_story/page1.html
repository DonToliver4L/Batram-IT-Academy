    <p class = "firstpage">This is The Legend Of Frosty The Snowman Story for kids. This story is the re-telling of the story “Frosty” from the book and the movie. Once upon a time, on a hill behind their house, Billy and Sally were sledding on the newly fallen snow.
        When Sally called for her brother to join her, she heard Joe’s voice.”Let’s create the biggest snowman ever!” he said excitedly. By the time the siblings joined Joe, he had already rolled up a huge ball of snow. Next, they rolled a medium and small sized snowball. After that, the children stacked them up. With various objects from the kids’ houses, the snowman was ready! Also, read Harry- The Happy Snowman. 
        All that was left was the hat. The kids had some and tried some- but nothing seemed right! Just then a whistling wind brought an old black top hat! And that was the right fit. What the kids did not know was that the hat was a magic hat.
