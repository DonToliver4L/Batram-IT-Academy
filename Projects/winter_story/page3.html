    <p class = "thirdpage"> When the kids could cross, they could not find Frosty. Here and there they looked, and could not see him. Then, the kids saw his top hat on a pile of snow. “Oh, Mr. Policeman,” cried the kids. “What has happened to Frosty our snowman?” 
        he kind policeman replies, “Don’t cry, little children. Frosty has gone to the place where all snowmen go when it is hot outside. It is nothing to worry about, on a cold day when the snow falls he’ll there again!”
