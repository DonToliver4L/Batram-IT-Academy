    <p class = "secondPage">With the help of Frosty, the kids found that their work had become tremendously easy. Snow house with snow blocks, easy as a breeze. And then, they went skating on the frozen lake. Oh, how fun was that! Every day, whenever the kids came out, Frosty was already there! With his red boots and a broom and that shiny top-hat, he made sure the day was full of fun and wonderful experiences! You may also like to read, Snowman Short Story.
        One day, Frosty said, “Let’s go shopping, I’ve never really seen a store before.” And so they went to a store. The kids showed his the stores with delicious food and other things under the winter sun and Frosty was overjoyed. A sudden warm wind blew away Frosty’s shiny hat, and he ran after it. But the kids were left behind.
